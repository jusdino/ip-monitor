# ip-monitor
A quick script for IP address monitoring, email notifications and DNS updates

To install:
 - Drop both of the bash scripts here into ~/bin
 - make a ~/.wanip folder and add a `ddns.conf` file, configured with any DNS entries you want updated similar to the example
 - add a crontab entry similar to the example

This assumes that you already have your local email server and mutt configured to send emails however you like.
